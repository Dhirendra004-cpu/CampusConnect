- Primary color: #4CAF50 (Green) to evoke a sense of growth and learning, as well as approachability.
- Background color: #F0F9F1 (Light Green) for a calm, clean, and professional feel.
- Accent color: #3F51B5 (Indigo) to provide contrast and highlight important interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for both headings and body, since a lot of text is not expected.
- Use Material Design Icons for a consistent and modern look.
- Employ a card-based layout to organize information on the dashboard, with clear sections for notices, events, and user profile.
- Subtle transition effects when navigating between pages.
